						## What is Hashing

						Etymology: (maybe) The term "hash" offers a natural analogy with its non-technical meaning (to "chop" or "make a mess" out of something).

						or more concretely:

						A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.

						---

						## Hash Tables

						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/hashing-Hash-Table.drawio.png"/>

						Hash values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Where you can then go and find some data.

						---
						

						## Properties of a good hashing function

						1. It should be very efficient to compute.
						2. The function needs to be determinist; you get the same output for the same input each time it is run.
						3. It should avoid collisions, no two inputs should produce the same output. If collision -> Bucketing.
						4. For encryption purposes, the output should not give any indication of the input

						---

						## Clashing and Performance

						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/hashing-Hash-Table-Clash.drawio.png"/>

						Hashh Tabble: Best ois O(1)
						Array Search: O(N)

						---

						## Examples

						* Modulo
						* MD5 (Message Digest)
						* SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm), SHA1, SHA2, SHA3, SHA-256
						* BLAKE2s
						* RIPEMD-160
						

						---

						Applications

						* Document integrity
						* Generate unique (almost) IDs
						* Git - Every time you commit something you get a lovely big hash value
						* Pseudorandom number generation
						* Proof of work algorithm
						* NFTs / Crypto Currency's

						## Cryptographic hashing vs just normal hashing

						A cryptographic hash function aims to guarantee a number of security properties.

						1. Most importantly that it's hard to find collisions 
						2. Output appears random

						## Caching

						<q>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</q>

						-- Phil Karlton

						<q>Premature optimization is the root of all evil</q>

						-- Donald Knuth

						---

						## What is a cache

						A cache is any data store that can store and retrieve data quickly for future use, enabling faster response times and decreasing load on other parts of your system.

						---

						## Why and how we cache

						Performance

						Caches can work in multiple ways:

						1. Store data closer to where it is likely to be needed
						2. Reduce repeated calculations / queries / requests to other services

						Usually want to measure cache 'hit-rate'

						---


						## Examples


						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/layers.png"/>

						---


						## Examples

						* DNS - TTL
						* Browser - Etags
						* Harddrives - Disk Buffer or Cahce Buffer
						* File system cache / CDNs - Cloudflare, Cloudfront
						* In-memory application cache - Spring-context, EHCache, just use a map of key / values
						* Database cache - integrated to db engine, built-in write-through capabilitie
						* Distributed cache - Memcache / Redis

						## Side track on memoization

						---

						## Caching strategies

						1. First in First out(FIFO)
						2. Least recently used (LRU)
						3. Least frequently used (LFU)

						---

						## Cache consistency - write through vs write back

						1. A write-through cache updates the cache and main memory simultaneously,
						2. In a write-behind cache, memory updates occur asynchronously.

						---

						## Consistent Hashing

						1. It may be necessary or desirable to split a hash table into several parts, hosted by different servers.
						2. The objects (and their keys) are distributed among several servers, hence the name.
						3. Many popular products use this technique: Dynamo DB, Memcache, Redis

						## How

						## How

						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/hashing-Hash-Table-3.drawio.png"/>

						---

						## Rehashing problem 
						
						What happens when the number of server changes?
						
						With app servers with no state they can quite happily scale up / down. With specific data stored on specific machines we need to know the machine the data is in.

						---

						## Back to our example

						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/hashing-Hash-Table-2.drawio.png"/>

						Only 2 key are the same! Even keys on servers A and C have moved.

						---
						## Solution

						We need a distribution scheme which doesn't rely on the number of servers, means key redistribution is minimized.

						---

						## Hash ring
						
						
						Introducing the hash ring, this is an abstract circle which you map your keys and servers to.

						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/hashing-Hashing-Circle-Initial.drawio.png"/>

						
						---

						## Hash Ring 2
						
						Now assign your servers to the same ring
						
						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/hashing-Hashing-Circle-Servers.drawio.png"/>
						

						---

						## Hash Ring 3

						Assign many labels per server to even out distribution

						<img class="r-stretch" src="./assets/hashing-Hashing-Circle-Detailed.drawio.png"/>

						---

						## Loose a server?
